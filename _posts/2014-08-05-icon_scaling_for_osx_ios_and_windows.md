Some time ago me and my friend finished some apps for IOS. One problem is, when you are finished with programming, a lot of work still needs to be done in order to publish the app: writing the decription for the App Store, create screenshots and of course create an icon for the app.

Especially for IOS apps creating the icon and use it in XCode is not that easy. A lot of different sizes need to be created:

Doing that manually involves a lot of work with your favorite image editing tool. So we created a small software tool for that. The Icon Scaler:

Just drop your icon image into the tool, select the output formats and click the export button. The tool can create icons for IOS (iPhone and iPad), OSX, Android and Windows.

The app is available in the [Mac App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=866537106). 

If you only need to resize icons for IOS and OSX you can have a look to our tool [Asset Scaler](https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/asset-scaler/id901167651?mt=12).
