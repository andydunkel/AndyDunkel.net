Recently I ran into a problem in my RCP application during the generation of a PDF file from a [BIRT](http://www.eclipse.org/birt/phoenix/) report. This only happened when trying to run the export from the exported product:

The first problem was an "Error.OutputFormatNotSupported".




This was a little bit strange, since I would have expected some syntax errors in my project trying to use stuff from another plugin that is referenced to my project.




Anyway, I was able to fix this by adding "org.eclipse.birt.engine.emitter.pdf" to my run configuration. After that I got another error:

> org.eclipse.birt.report.engine.api.engineexception cant create data engine

Remembering that I am using JavaScript in my BIRT report, the approach was similar. Just a missing reference to "org.eclipse.birt.report.engine.script.javascript".
