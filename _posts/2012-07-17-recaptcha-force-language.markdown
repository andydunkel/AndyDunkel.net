Recent problem: customer wanted his [reCatpcha](http://www.google.com/recaptcha) forced to german language. First attempt was to set the setting via the RecaptchaOption Script variable. Howewer, for some reason this did not work.




Here is the solution:



    
    <script type="text/javascript" 
    src="http://api.recaptcha.net/challenge?k=apiKey<strong>&hl=de</strong>">Â 




By adding &hl=de to the "src" URL the language was forced to german.
