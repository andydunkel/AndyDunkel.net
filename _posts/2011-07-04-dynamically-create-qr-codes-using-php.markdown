Today I wrote a blog entry [about QR codes](http://blog.ekiwi.de/?p=542) in our [eKiwi.de](http://www.ekiwi.de) blog. There we where using an online tool to create the QR code. 

If you want to create QR codes dynamically on your website, you can use the class from [http://phpqrcode.sourceforge.net/](http://phpqrcode.sourceforge.net/)

The usage is pretty simple. In this example I created an image php file:




    
    
    





This outputs date and time into a QR code and outputs a PNG file. In the HTML file we only have to show the image:



    
    
    <img src="img.php">




The QR code looks like that (if you do a refresh in the browser the code will change):

And thatâ€™s it. ![Smiley](https://andydunkel.net/assets/uploads/2011/07/wlEmoticon-smile.png) More documentation can be found on the projects homepage.

Here is the complete [example as download](https://andydunkel.net/assets/wp-custom/qrcode/qrcode.zip).
